# Portfolio_Varel

Hey there! I'm Varel, a data enthusiast who loves turning numbers into stories that actually matter.
What you'll find here üîç
This repository showcases my journey from academic research to real-world business applications. Whether it's analyzing complex datasets or building dashboards that drive decisions, I enjoy making data work for people.
My toolkit includes:

Data Analysis & Visualization - Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel
Business Intelligence - Creating dashboards and reports that stakeholders actually use
Data Management - Cleaning, processing, and maintaining data accuracy
Statistical Modeling - Applying analytical thinking to solve practical problems

A bit about me üöÄ
I've had the chance to work across different industries - from managing 500+ product codes daily at Sainsbury's to building dynamic dashboards at Gammon India. What I love most is how the same analytical skills that work for academic research also help businesses make better decisions.
Whether it's tracking inventory, measuring performance, or finding insights in messy data, I'm here to help make sense of it all.
Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to chat about data, analytics, or anything in between! ‚òï
